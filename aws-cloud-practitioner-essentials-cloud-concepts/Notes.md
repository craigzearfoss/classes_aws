# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials - Cloud Concepts
- AWS Training and Certification
- Completed Apr 25, 2019
---
### Increase speed and global reach
- Global reach with a moment's notice
- New resources are a click away
		
### Increase Experimentation
- Operations as code
- Safely experiment
- For example:
  - Spin up servers in minutes for experimenting
  - Return or re-purpose servers
-Tesing using different configurations
- AWS CloudFormation enables templated environments
		
- Increase innovation
  - Experiment quickly with low cost / risk
  - More experimentation more often
		
### The AWS Infrastructure
- Elasticity, scalability, and reliability of computing resources
	
### Regions
- Physical location in the world
- Contains multiple Availbility Zones
		
### Availability Zones (AZs)
- One of more discrete data centers
- Redundant power / networking / connectivity
- Housed in separaate facilities

###	Availability Zones
- **Fault tolerance**
  - the ability for a system to remain operational even of some components of that system fails.
	- It can be seen as the built in redundancy of a system's application.
	
- **High Availability**
  - Systems "always" functioning and accessible
	- Downtime is minimized as much and possible
	- Without human intervention
		
- **Elasticity**
	- scale computing up or down easilty
	- quickly  deploy new applications
	- instantly scale up as the workload increases
	- Instantly shut down resources that are no longer required
	- Scale down and don't pay for the inrastructure
		
### AWS provides the elastic infrastructure to meet your needs
	
### Use services at your own pace
	
### Adapt their consumption
	
### Launch new services or products
	
### Accommodate new strategic directions
	
### Tools to run a wide range of applications
	
### **Auto Scaling** and **Elastic Load Balancing**
- Scale up or down based on demand
		
### Deploy your system in multiple regions
- Lower latency and better experience
		
### Innovative Services and cutting-edge technology
	
### Virtually any workload
	
### **Security and Compliance**
- Customer retains control over reion where data located
- Security auditing often periodic and manual
- AWS cloud provides governance capabilites
- Industry-leading capabilities  that meet the strictest security requirements
- Data centers
	-  State-of-the-art electronic survellience
	- Multi-factor access control systems
	- Staffed 24x7 by trained security guards
	- Access is strictly least-privileged basis
	- Environmental systems minimize the impact of disruptions
	- Multiple regions and Availability Zones enable resiliency
- Security policy can be formalized and embedded with the design of infrastructure
		
### **Reliability**
- High performing and reliable solutions
- Implement solutions quickly and with limited friction
- Reliability
	- Ability to recover from failures
	- Dynamically acquire resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions
- Must have well-planned foundation
	- Handle changes in demand
	- Detect failure and automatically heal itself
- Achieve greater flexibility and capacity
- Reduce uncertainty of forecasting hardware needs
- Capacity and reliability that is difficult to match by on-spremise solutions
		
### **Pricing** - Pay as you go
- Avoid didicating resources to infrastructure
- Benefits of pay-as-you-go
	- Redirect focus to innovation and invention
	- Reduce procurement complexity
	- Enable elasticity
	- Adapt to changing business needs
	- Improve responsiveness to changes
	- Reducing risk or overprovisioning or missing capacity
